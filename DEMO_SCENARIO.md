# Customer Call Center Analytics - Decision Agent Demo Scenario

## Overview
This demo showcases the complete end-to-end workflow with the new **Decision Agent** implementation, featuring per-action risk evaluation and intelligent approval routing. The system now implements the "For Each Action Item ‚Üí Needs Approval? ‚Üí Route" architecture pattern.

## Demo Flow

### 1. Initial Setup
The system has been pre-loaded with:
- Sample mortgage servicing transcripts (PMI removal, payment disputes, etc.)
- Decision Agent with configurable risk thresholds
- Mock integration tools for creating visible artifacts
- Approval workflow database schemas

### 2. Analysis & Planning Phase

#### Generate & Analyze a Customer Call
```bash
# Generate a complex PMI removal scenario
python cli_fast.py generate --store scenario="Mortgage Servicing - PMI Removal - complex scenario with property valuation dispute and compliance requirements" urgency=high financial_impact=true

# Analyze the transcript
python cli_fast.py analyze --all
```

#### Generate Action Plans with Decision Agent
```bash
# Generate multi-layer action plans with per-action risk evaluation
python cli_fast.py generate-action-plan --transcript-id CALL_1DAD039C

# The Decision Agent automatically:
# - Evaluates each action individually for risk
# - Assigns financial_impact, compliance_impact, customer_facing flags
# - Calculates risk scores (0-1 scale)
# - Routes actions: auto_approved, advisor_approval, supervisor_approval
# - Creates approval queue entries for pending actions
```

**Sample Output:**
```
‚úÖ Generated action plan: 655b8a3c-a878-41cb-aaf8-17f76ec478e7
Risk Level: high
Approval Route: supervisor_approval
Queue Status: pending_supervisor
```

#### Review Action Plans & Approval Queue
```bash
# View the detailed action plan
python cli_fast.py view-action-plan 655b8a3c-a878-41cb-aaf8-17f76ec478e7

# Check Decision Agent configuration and processing summary
python cli_fast.py decision-agent-summary

# View approval queue (per-action level)
python cli_fast.py get-approval-queue --route supervisor_approval
```

### 3. Approval Workflow Phase

#### Decision Agent Routing Results
The Decision Agent evaluates actions based on:
- **Financial Impact**: Refunds, payments, fee adjustments (+0.4 risk score)
- **Compliance Impact**: Regulatory requirements, disclosures (+0.3 risk score)  
- **Customer-Facing**: Direct customer communications (+0.2 if high complaint risk)
- **High-Risk Keywords**: Escalate, terminate, override, waive (+0.3 risk score)
- **Business Rules**: Financial/compliance actions always require supervisor approval

**Routing Logic:**
- **Risk Score < 0.3**: Auto-approved ‚úÖ
- **Risk Score 0.3-0.7**: Advisor approval required üîÑ
- **Risk Score > 0.7**: Supervisor approval required ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Manage Approvals
```bash
# Approve individual actions
python cli_fast.py approve-action ACT_BORR_SEND_EMAIL_A7B2C9 --approved-by "supervisor_jane" --notes "Approved - standard PMI removal communication"

# Reject actions if needed
python cli_fast.py reject-action ACT_BORR_EXPEDITE_A7B2C9 --rejected-by "supervisor_jane" --reason "Expedited processing requires additional documentation"

# Bulk approve multiple low-risk actions
python cli_fast.py bulk-approve "ACT_ADVI_COACH_B7C2D9,ACT_LEAD_INSIGHTS_C7D2E9" --approved-by "supervisor_jane"

# Check approval metrics
python cli_fast.py approval-metrics
```

### 4. Execution Phase (with Approval Checking)

#### Execute Action Plans
```bash
# Execute approved action plans (now checks individual action approval status)
python cli_fast.py execute-plan 655b8a3c-a878-41cb-aaf8-17f76ec478e7

# The Smart Executor now:
# - Checks each action's needs_approval and approval_status fields
# - Skips actions awaiting approval with status "Awaiting approval"
# - Executes only approved or auto-approved actions
# - NO FALLBACK logic - fails fast if LLM is unavailable (per requirements)
```

**Sample Execution Results:**
```
‚úÖ Borrower Actions: 3 executed, 2 skipped (awaiting approval)
‚úÖ Advisor Actions: 4 executed, 0 skipped  
‚úÖ Supervisor Actions: 1 executed, 1 skipped (awaiting approval)
‚úÖ Leadership Actions: 2 executed, 0 skipped
‚úÖ Artifacts Created: 7 files
```

#### Monitor Execution with Approval Awareness
```bash
# View execution history with approval skip tracking
python cli_fast.py execution-history --limit 10

# Check enhanced execution metrics
python cli_fast.py execution-metrics
# Now includes:
# - actions_skipped_for_approval: 3
# - actions_awaiting_approval: 3  
# - approval_skip_rate: 23.1%

# View created artifacts
python cli_fast.py view-artifacts --execution-id EXEC_AEADF68F9B
```
