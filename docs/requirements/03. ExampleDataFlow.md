Complete Example: Refinance with Hardship - End-to-End Flow

  1. ðŸ“ž Customer Call (Transcript)

  AGENT: Thank you for calling mortgage services. How can I help you today?

  CUSTOMER: Hi, I'm really stressed. I lost my job at the aerospace company three months ago due to layoffs. I've been making partial payments but I'm falling behind.
  My mortgage is $3,200 a month at 7.5% interest.

  AGENT: I'm sorry to hear about your job loss. Have you found new employment?

  CUSTOMER: Yes, I just started a new job two weeks ago, but it pays about 35% less than my previous position. I'm making $5,500 a month now instead of $8,500. I need
  help - maybe refinancing to lower my payment? Or are there any hardship programs?

  AGENT: Let me check both options for you. What's your loan number?

  CUSTOMER: It's LN-784523. I've never missed a payment before this happened. My credit was excellent.

  AGENT: I see you've been a customer for 7 years with perfect payment history until recently. Let me review all available options including refinancing and our
  hardship assistance programs...
