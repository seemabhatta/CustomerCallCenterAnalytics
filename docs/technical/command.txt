CLI vs Server API Comparison

  ✅ Matched Commands (Both CLI and API exist):

  Transcript:
  - transcript create → POST /api/v1/transcripts
  - transcript list → GET /api/v1/transcripts
  - transcript get → GET /api/v1/transcripts/{transcript_id}
  - transcript delete → DELETE /api/v1/transcripts/{transcript_id}

  Analysis:
  - analysis create → POST /api/v1/analyses
  - analysis list → GET /api/v1/analyses
  - analysis get → GET /api/v1/analyses/{analysis_id}
  - analysis delete → DELETE /api/v1/analyses/{analysis_id}
  - analysis delete-all → DELETE /api/v1/analyses

  Insights:
  - insights patterns → GET /api/v1/insights/patterns
  - insights dashboard → GET /api/v1/insights/dashboard
  - insights populate → POST /api/v1/insights/populate
  - insights status → GET /api/v1/insights/status

  Plan:
  - plan create → POST /api/v1/plans
  - plan list → GET /api/v1/plans
  - plan view → GET /api/v1/plans/{plan_id}
  - plan delete → DELETE /api/v1/plans/{plan_id}
  - plan delete-all → DELETE /api/v1/plans

  Workflow:
  - workflow extract-all → POST /api/v1/workflows/extract-all
  - workflow list → GET /api/v1/workflows
  - workflow details → GET /api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}
  - workflow approve → POST /api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/approve
  - workflow execute → POST /api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/execute
  - workflow delete → DELETE /api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}
  - workflow delete-all → DELETE /api/v1/workflows

  Execution:
  - execution list → GET /api/v1/executions
  - execution get → GET /api/v1/executions/{execution_id}
  - execution delete → DELETE /api/v1/executions/{execution_id}
  - execution delete-all → DELETE /api/v1/executions
  - execution statistics → GET /api/v1/executions/statistics

  System:
  - system health → GET /api/v1/health
  - system metrics → GET /api/v1/metrics

  ❌ Mismatches Found:

  1. CLI Commands WITHOUT corresponding API:
  - orchestrate run - No API endpoint (orchestrates multiple operations)
  - orchestrate execute-approved - Uses POST /api/v1/workflows/execute-all indirectly
  - system tree - Local CLI feature, no API needed

  2. API Endpoints WITHOUT CLI commands:
  - POST /api/v1/workflows/execute-all - Used by orchestrate execute-approved but not directly exposed

  Summary:

  - 33 API endpoints → 32 have CLI commands
  - 35 CLI commands → 32 have API endpoints
  - 3 CLI-only commands (orchestrate run, execute-approved, system tree)
  - 1 API-only endpoint (/api/v1/workflows/execute-all - used indirectly)

  The mismatches are intentional:
  - orchestrate commands are high-level CLI orchestrators that combine multiple API calls
  - system tree is a local CLI visualization feature
  - /api/v1/workflows/execute-all is used by orchestrate execute-approved internally
