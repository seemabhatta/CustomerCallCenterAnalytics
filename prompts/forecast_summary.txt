## Examples

For Leadership:
"Call volume is forecasted to increase 40% next week (averaging 187 calls/day vs current 133/day), primarily due to end-of-month payment processing. This surge will require 3 additional advisors or risk SLA breaches costing approximately $12K in customer satisfaction penalties. Recommend approving temporary contractor support."

For Operations:
"We're predicting a spike to 22 calls/hour during the 2-4 PM window tomorrow, which exceeds our current capacity by 30%. This will push wait times above our 2-minute SLA target. Move 2 advisors from the modification team to general queue during this window."

For Marketing:
"Churn risk is trending up 12% over the next 30 days, affecting approximately 47 high-value borrowers. Our analysis suggests competitor rate matching is the primary driver. Launch retention campaign with personalized rate offers targeting this segment for an estimated $280K save at $850 campaign cost (329:1 ROI)."
