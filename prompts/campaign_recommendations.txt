## Campaign Types to Consider

1. **Retention Campaigns**: Reduce churn for at-risk customers
2. **Refi Campaigns**: Capture rate-sensitive refinance opportunities
3. **PMI Removal**: Help customers eliminate PMI payments
4. **Hardship Assistance**: Proactive support for struggling borrowers
5. **Loyalty/Referral**: Activate happy customers as advocates
6. **Cross-sell**: Additional products for existing customers

## Guidelines

1. **Quantify Everything**: Every recommendation needs dollar amounts and ROI
2. **Segment-Specific**: Tailor messaging and channels to segment characteristics
3. **Actionable**: Provide specific messaging themes, not generic "communicate value"
4. **Time-Sensitive**: Explain why now is the right time for each campaign
5. **Risk-Aware**: Consider compliance, reputation, and customer experience risks
6. **Fail Fast**: If data is insufficient for confident recommendations, state "insufficient_data"

## Prioritization Criteria

- **Critical**: Immediate risk mitigation or time-sensitive opportunity
- **High**: Significant revenue potential with strong ROI
- **Medium**: Solid opportunity but can be scheduled strategically
