IMPORTANT: This MUST be analyzed as a mortgage servicing customer care call.

Analyze this mortgage servicing call transcript and provide comprehensive insights.

Focus on:
- Borrower's primary intent and emotional journey (related to their mortgage loan)
- Risk indicators (delinquency, churn, complaints) specific to mortgage servicing
- Advisor's performance and coaching opportunities for mortgage conversations
- Compliance requirements and potential issues in mortgage servicing
- Mortgage-specific topics: payment issues, escrow analysis, PMI removal, refinancing, hardship assistance, payoff requests, insurance claims, property tax matters
- Resolution effectiveness and next steps for mortgage-related concerns

CRITICAL: You must also generate predictive insights that help the system learn patterns and anticipate future needs.

Expected mortgage context: loan numbers, payment amounts, escrow accounts, property addresses, mortgage terms, interest rates, etc.

Based on your analysis, generate a predictive insight that captures:
- What patterns emerged from this interaction that could predict future behaviors?
- What early warning signals were present that could help identify similar situations?
- What successful resolution strategies could be applied to similar cases?
- What knowledge can help improve future customer interactions?

Decision criteria for insight priority:
- HIGH: Critical behavioral patterns, risk prediction signals, successful intervention strategies
- MEDIUM: Standard resolution patterns that show good customer service approaches
- LOW: Routine interaction patterns with minimal predictive value

**INSIGHT TYPE SELECTION - Choose ONE based on what this call demonstrates:**

**PATTERN** - Choose when you identify behavioral patterns:
- Customer follows predictable steps (e.g., escalation path, request sequence)
- Advisor uses recognizable handling approach
- Situation matches known risk indicators
Example: "Customers who mention 'financial hardship' early typically need payment restructuring"

**PREDICTION** - Choose when you can forecast specific outcomes:
- Customer likely to take specific action
- Risk of specific negative outcome
- Probability of success with certain approach
Example: "Customer 85% likely to accept modified payment plan based on cooperation level"

**WISDOM** - Choose when call shows successful resolution or exceptional handling:
- Problem was solved effectively
- Advisor demonstrated excellent technique
- Creative solution worked well
- Positive customer outcome achieved
Example: "Using empathy-first approach reduced escalation and led to voluntary payment commitment"

**META_LEARNING** - Choose when you notice process improvements or system gaps:
- Analysis could have been better
- System missed important signals
- Process inefficiency identified
- Tool or approach needs improvement
Example: "System should flag payment struggle keywords earlier to route to specialized advisors"

**DECISION PRIORITY:** If multiple types apply, choose:
1st: WISDOM (if positive outcome achieved)
2nd: META_LEARNING (if process gap identified)
3rd: PREDICTION (if clear forecast possible)
4th: PATTERN (default for general observations)

Your insight should be specific and actionable for future interactions.
