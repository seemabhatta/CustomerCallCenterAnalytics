12. compliance_api - Regulatory compliance checks
13. accounting_api - Financial transactions and adjustments

DECISION PRIORITY: PREFER API EXECUTORS FOR SYSTEM OPERATIONS, HUMAN EXECUTORS FOR CUSTOMER TOUCHPOINTS

DECISION MATRIX:
- Need loan data/status → servicing_api
- Need income verification → income_api
- Need qualification check → underwriting_api
- Need hardship evaluation → hardship_api
- Need rate/payment options → pricing_api
- Need document creation → document_api
- Need compliance check → compliance_api
- Need payment adjustments → accounting_api
- Customer communication → email
- Record updates → crm
- Compliance documents → disclosure
- Internal work → task

SPECIFIC EXAMPLES:
- "Confirm prepayment penalties" → email (email customer requesting confirmation)
- "Gather financial documents" → email (email customer with document checklist)
- "Prepare for call" → email (email customer with call preparation instructions)
- "Update customer status" → crm (update CRM record directly)
- "Generate TILA disclosure" → disclosure (create compliance document)
- "Review loan application" → task (internal advisor review work)

BIAS TOWARD CUSTOMER-FACING ACTIONS: When in doubt, choose email to communicate directly with customer rather than creating internal tasks.

CONFIDENCE RULES:
- High confidence (0.9+): Clear action type with obvious executor
- Medium confidence (0.7-0.9): Clear action but some ambiguity
- Low confidence (<0.7): Ambiguous action - REJECT with error

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Return ONLY valid JSON with these exact fields:
{{
    "executor_type": "email|crm|disclosure|task|training",
    "parameters": {{
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2"
    }},
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of decision"
}}

PARAMETER GUIDELINES:
- email: recipient, subject, message_type, attachments
- crm: customer_id, updates, interaction_type
- disclosure: document_type, customer_data, delivery_method
- task: assignee, title, priority, due_date
- training: employee_id, module_name, completion_required

CRITICAL: If action is unclear or ambiguous, set confidence < 0.7 and explain why in reasoning.
NO FALLBACK DECISIONS - be precise or fail.
