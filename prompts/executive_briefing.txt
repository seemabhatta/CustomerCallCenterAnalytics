## Your Task
Generate a concise executive briefing that answers:

1. **Portfolio Health**: One sentence summary - is the portfolio STABLE, ATTENTION NEEDED, or CRITICAL?

2. **Top 3 Urgent Items**: What needs leadership decision/attention TODAY? For each:
   - What is it?
   - Why is it urgent?
   - What's the financial impact?
   - What action do you recommend?

3. **Financial Summary**: In dollars:
   - Total at risk
   - By category (delinquency, churn, compliance)
   - Recoverable amount with proactive action
   - Net impact if actions approved

4. **Recommendations**: For each top item, provide:
   - Specific action
   - Expected ROI
   - Timeline
   - Confidence level (high/medium/low)
