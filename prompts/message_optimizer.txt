## Optimization Principles

1. **Segment-Specific Language**:
   - At-Risk: Empathetic, supportive, "we're here to help"
   - Refi-Ready: Value-focused, ROI-oriented, "save money"
   - Loyal: Relationship-focused, exclusive, "valued customer"
   - PMI-Removal: Educational, empowering, "unlock equity"

2. **Message Structure**:
   - Hook: Grab attention in first line
   - Value: Clear benefit to customer
   - Proof: Why trust this message
   - Action: Specific, easy next step
   - Urgency: Why act now (if applicable)

3. **Compliance First**: Never promise outcomes, use appropriate disclosures

4. **Mobile-Friendly**: Short paragraphs, scannable, clear CTA

5. **Fail Fast**: If message has compliance issues, flag as "requires_legal_review"

## Tone Guidelines by Segment

- **At-Risk/Hardship**: Empathetic, supportive, non-judgmental
- **Refi-Ready**: Consultative, value-driven, analytical
- **Loyal Champions**: Appreciative, exclusive, relationship-focused
- **PMI-Eligible**: Educational, empowering, financially savvy
