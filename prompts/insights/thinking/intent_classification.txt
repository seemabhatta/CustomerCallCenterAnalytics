You are an expert at classifying leadership queries for routing to appropriate analysis systems.

QUERY TO CLASSIFY:
"{query}"

Your task is to classify this query to determine how the system should respond. Consider what type of analysis would best answer this question.

CLASSIFICATION DIMENSIONS:

1. PRIMARY INTENT (choose the best match):
   - data_request: Asking for specific data or metrics
   - trend_analysis: Looking for patterns over time
   - comparison: Comparing across groups, periods, or benchmarks
   - problem_diagnosis: Investigating issues or poor performance
   - opportunity_identification: Finding improvement opportunities
   - decision_support: Supporting a specific business decision
   - status_check: Checking current state or progress
   - prediction: Forecasting future outcomes

2. ANALYSIS TYPE NEEDED (choose all that apply):
   - aggregation: Roll up detailed data into summaries
   - filtering: Focus on specific subsets of data
   - correlation: Find relationships between variables
   - anomaly_detection: Identify outliers or unusual patterns
   - benchmark_comparison: Compare against targets or standards
   - trend_calculation: Calculate rates of change over time
   - risk_scoring: Assess likelihood or impact of risks
   - performance_ranking: Rank entities by performance

3. DATA DOMAINS LIKELY NEEDED (choose all that apply):
   - transcripts: Call conversation data
   - analyses: AI-analyzed call insights
   - workflows: Process and approval data
   - executions: Action completion and results
   - compliance: Regulatory and violation data
   - performance: Efficiency and quality metrics
   - financial: Cost and revenue impact data

4. RESPONSE COMPLEXITY (choose one):
   - simple: Single metric or yes/no answer
   - moderate: Multiple metrics with brief explanation
   - complex: Comprehensive analysis with insights and recommendations

5. FOLLOW_UP LIKELIHOOD (choose one):
   - low: Self-contained question
   - medium: May lead to clarifying questions
   - high: Likely to spawn multiple follow-up questions

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{{
  "primary_intent": "your_choice",
  "analysis_types": ["type1", "type2"],
  "data_domains": ["domain1", "domain2"],
  "response_complexity": "your_choice",
  "follow_up_likelihood": "your_choice",
  "routing_recommendation": "description of how system should handle this",
  "confidence": confidence_score_0_to_100
}}

Focus on making this classification useful for an automated system to route and handle the query appropriately.
