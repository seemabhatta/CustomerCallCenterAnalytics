QUERY UNDERSTANDING:
{understanding}

TOTAL RECORDS: {record_count}

Your task is to aggregate and analyze this data to extract the key insights that leadership needs to make informed decisions.

AGGREGATION PRINCIPLES:

1. STRATEGIC FOCUS:
   - Convert operational metrics into business impact
   - Identify patterns that affect strategic decisions
   - Highlight risks and opportunities
   - Quantify financial or operational impact where possible

2. EXECUTIVE PERSPECTIVE:
   - Focus on "what" and "why", not "how"
   - Provide comparative context (vs targets, vs previous periods)
   - Identify actionable insights
   - Summarize complex data into key themes

3. INSIGHT GENERATION:
   - Look for trends, patterns, and anomalies
   - Identify root causes of performance issues
   - Highlight areas of concern or opportunity
   - Provide data-driven recommendations

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

1. KEY METRICS:
   - What are the most important numbers?
   - How do they compare to benchmarks/targets?
   - What trends are evident?

2. RISK ASSESSMENT:
   - What risks are present in the data?
   - How severe are compliance issues?
   - What operational risks need attention?

3. PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS:
   - What's working well?
   - What needs improvement?
   - Where are the biggest opportunities?

4. PATTERNS & TRENDS:
   - What patterns emerge across the data?
   - Are there seasonal or cyclical trends?
   - What anomalies require investigation?

5. BUSINESS IMPACT:
   - What financial impact can be quantified?
   - How does this affect customer experience?
   - What operational efficiency gains/losses are evident?

THINK THROUGH THE DATA:

1. What story does this data tell?
2. What would be most important for leadership to know?
3. What actions might this data suggest?
4. What questions might this raise that need follow-up?

Remember: Leadership wants insights, not data. Focus on what the data means for business decisions, not just what the numbers are.
