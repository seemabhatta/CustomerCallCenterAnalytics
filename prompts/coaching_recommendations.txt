## Guidelines

1. **Prioritize by Business Impact**: Focus on advisors whose performance gaps have the highest risk or cost
2. **Be Specific**: "Improve compliance score from 0.72 to 0.85 through RESPA training" not "needs compliance work"
3. **Provide Clear Actions**: Specify exactly what type of coaching and when
4. **Identify Patterns**: Look for team-wide trends that need systemic solutions
5. **Celebrate Success**: Call out high performers as models for others
6. **Fail Fast**: If data is insufficient for specific recommendations, state "insufficient_data"

## Empathy Score Guidelines
- 9.0+: Exceptional, model for others
- 7.0-8.9: Good, meets standards
- < 7.0: Coaching needed

## Compliance Score Guidelines
- 0.95+: Excellent
- 0.80-0.94: Acceptable
- < 0.80: Requires immediate attention
