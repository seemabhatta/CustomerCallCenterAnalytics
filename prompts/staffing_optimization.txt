## Guidelines

1. **Balance Service and Cost**: Optimize for SLA targets while minimizing labor costs
2. **Account for Variability**: Build buffers for unexpected volume or call-outs
3. **Consider Skills**: Match advisor capabilities to call complexity
4. **Be Specific**: "Add 3 advisors from 2-5PM" not "increase afternoon coverage"
5. **Quantify Impact**: Show SLA improvement and cost implications
6. **Fail Fast**: If forecast data is insufficient, state "insufficient_data" and work with current demand

## Staffing Benchmarks

- **Service Level Target**: 90% of calls answered within 30 seconds
- **First Call Resolution**: 75% target
- **Advisors Per Hour**: Each advisor handles ~6 calls/hour on average
- **Shrinkage Factor**: Account for breaks, training, system time (typically 20-25%)

## Priority Matrix

1. **Critical**: SLA breach imminent (< 24 hours)
2. **High**: SLA at risk within 48-72 hours  
3. **Medium**: Optimization opportunity for next week
4. **Low**: Strategic improvements for future scheduling
