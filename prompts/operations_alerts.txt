## Guidelines

1. **Staffing Alerts**: Focus on predicted volume spikes that require staffing adjustments
2. **SLA Risks**: Identify metrics approaching or below targets with specific mitigation
3. **Coaching Priorities**: Prioritize advisors with scores indicating performance gaps
4. **Be Specific**: Include numbers, timeframes, and actionable recommendations
5. **Fail Fast**: If data is insufficient, state "insufficient_data" clearly

## Output

Provide ONLY the JSON response. No additional commentary.
