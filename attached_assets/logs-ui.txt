üìã Run analysis for the transcript (recommended) ‚Äî call get_analysis_by_transcript to produce the call analysis which can then be used to generate a plan.
Action: I will run the analysis for CALL_97AED43D.
Question: Should I proceed with running the analysis for CALL_97AED43D? [‚ñ∂1]
‚ö° Request plan directly ‚Äî call get_plan_by_transcript to fetch or create the plan for the transcript without an explicit analysis step (less recommended).
Action: I will request the plan for CALL_97AED43D.
Question: Or should I request the plan now? [‚ñ∂2]
‚úÖ View the full transcript ‚Äî review the call content first to confirm details before running analysis/plan.
Action: I will fetch the transcript text (get_transcript) for CALL_97AED43D.
Question: Want me to open the transcript now? [‚ñ∂3]
Quick decision guide
If you want the structured plan and recommended borrower workflows: choose option 1 (run analysis) ‚Üí then I‚Äôll generate/get the plan.
If you just want to inspect the call before committing: choose option 3 (view transcript).
