It looks like the transcript with ID CALL_001 isn’t available or may have been deleted. Would you like me to list all current transcript IDs so you can choose one to open?

There’s just one call transcript in the system — but it seems its ID might not be retrievable directly. Would you like me to try fetching its metadata (like date, customer, and topic) so we can identify it properly?

There’s one transcript in the system, but the system isn’t showing its detailed metadata yet.
Would you like me to regenerate or recreate that call transcript so you can review it?
