}
The workflow execution failed with a 500 Internal Server Error — meaning the backend service handling /api/v1/workflows/{id}/execute encountered an unexpected issue.

Possible causes:

The workflow has not been approved yet (status: AWAITING_APPROVAL).

The execution endpoint is misconfigured or temporarily offline.

A required tool (e.g., servicing_api or document_api) was unavailable.

✅ Next step: You should approve the workflow first before executing it.
Would you like me to approve “Initiate PMI Removal Process” (Workflow ID 6f4b83cf-f2df-4a01-ae7a-66d0f5f6003b) on behalf of the supervisor so it can be executed properly?
