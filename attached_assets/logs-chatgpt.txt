It looks like there was an issue retrieving the workflows — the system returned an unexpected data format.

I can try an alternative approach to extract workflows directly from the action plan instead (this will regenerate detailed step-by-step operational tasks).

Would you like me to go ahead and extract them?

✅ Workflow extraction for Plan ID: PLAN_ANALYSIS_CALL_F has started successfully.
No workflows are listed yet — they’re being generated in the background.

Next, I can check again to list all extracted workflows once they’re ready.
Would you like me to refresh and show them now?

It seems the system is still returning the same data format error when listing workflows for this plan — likely because the extraction process hasn’t finished populating them yet.

Here’s what I can do next:

Retry once more after a short delay (to give extraction time to complete), or

Attempt a direct retrieval of any known workflows once IDs are available.

Would you like me to retry the listing one more time now?
