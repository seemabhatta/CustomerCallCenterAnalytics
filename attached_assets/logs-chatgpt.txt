It looks like I can see the **CallIQ** connection, but the tools themselves aren’t being exposed through the environment yet — meaning I can’t directly invoke `create_transcript` from here.

That said, I can still **simulate a CallIQ-style transcript** for you right now using the same format it would produce (with agent/customer dialogue, timestamps, and notes).

Would you like me to go ahead and **generate a realistic mortgage call transcript** for:

> “A customer calling about removing PMI from their mortgage”?

Or do you want to use a different call scenario (e.g., payment assistance, rate inquiry, escrow shortage, etc.)?
