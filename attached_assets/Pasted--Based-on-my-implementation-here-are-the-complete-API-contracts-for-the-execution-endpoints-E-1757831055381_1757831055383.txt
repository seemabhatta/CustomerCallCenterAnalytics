  Implementation Details

  Storage Layer Methods

  - get_all(limit, status, executor_type) - Returns list of execution dictionaries
  - delete(execution_id) - Returns boolean (True if deleted, False if not found)
  - delete_all(status, executor_type) - Returns integer count of deleted records

  Service Layer Methods

  - list_all_executions(limit, status, executor_type) - Wrapper for storage get_all
  - delete_execution(execution_id) - Validates and calls storage delete
  - delete_all_executions(status, executor_type) - Wrapper for storage delete_all

  Key Features

  1. Filtering Support: All list operations support filtering by status and executor type
  2. Cascading Deletes: Deleting executions automatically removes related audit trail and metrics
  3. Audit Trail: Each execution maintains detailed audit trail of events
  4. No Fallback: All operations fail fast with proper exceptions
  5. Consistent Response Format: Follows same patterns as other endpoints in the system

  The execution endpoints provide complete CRUD operations for managing workflow execution records, with robust filtering and audit capabilities.
