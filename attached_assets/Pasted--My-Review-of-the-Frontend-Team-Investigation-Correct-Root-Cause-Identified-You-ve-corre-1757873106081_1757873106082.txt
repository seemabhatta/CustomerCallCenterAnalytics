 My Review of the Frontend Team Investigation

  ✅ Correct Root Cause Identified

  You've correctly identified that the workflow DOES exist in the backend with:
  - plan_id: "PLAN_ANALYSIS_CALL_4"
  - status: "AWAITING_APPROVAL"
  - workflow_type: "BORROWER"
  - risk_level: "HIGH"

  ⚠️ Critical Issues to Check FIRST

  Before the frontend team starts debugging filters, they should verify TWO separate issues:

  1. PlanView Button State Issue (Why button doesn't disable)

  The hasWorkflow() function in PlanView.tsx needs to work with the data structure. Have them check:

  // In PlanView.tsx - Check if workflows array is even populated
  console.log('Raw workflows data:', workflows);
  console.log('Type of workflows:', typeof workflows);
  console.log('Is array?:', Array.isArray(workflows));

  // Then check the hasWorkflow logic
  const hasWorkflow = (planId: string) => {
    console.log(`Checking for planId: ${planId}`);
    const found = workflows.some((workflow: any) => {
      console.log(`Comparing ${workflow.plan_id} === ${planId}`);
      return workflow.plan_id === planId;
    });
    console.log(`hasWorkflow result: ${found}`);
    return found;
  };

  2. WorkflowView Display Issue (Why workflow doesn't show)

  This is likely the filter issue you identified, but they should check the data flow first:

  // In WorkflowView.tsx - At the very top of the component
  console.log('WorkflowView received workflows:', workflows);
  console.log('Number of workflows:', workflows?.length);

  // After any filtering
  console.log('Workflows after filtering:', filteredWorkflows);

  🔍 Order of Investigation

  1. First: Confirm PlanView receives the workflow data
  2. Second: Fix the button state issue (hasWorkflow function)
  3. Third: Check WorkflowView filters
  4. Fourth: Fix any display filters

  📋 Checklist for Frontend Team

  Before changing any code, have them answer:

  - Does workflowApi.list() return the full array including "AWAITING_APPROVAL" workflows?
  - Does PlanView's workflows variable contain the data?
  - Does hasWorkflow('PLAN_ANALYSIS_CALL_4') return true or false?
  - Does WorkflowView receive all workflows or already filtered data?
  - Are there any default filters in WorkflowView state initialization?

  🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

  1. Don't assume the API client is working - Log the raw response
  2. Check for silent errors - Look for try/catch blocks swallowing errors
  3. Verify array vs object - Make sure workflows is an array, not wrapped in an object
  4. Check for case sensitivity - "PLAN_ANALYSIS_CALL_4" vs "plan_analysis_call_4"

  💡 My Recommendation

  Have the frontend team run this diagnostic code first in the browser console:

  // Full diagnostic check
  (async () => {
    // 1. Check raw API
    const rawResponse = await fetch('/api/v1/workflows');
    const rawData = await rawResponse.json();
    console.log('1. Raw API response:', rawData);

    // 2. Check if it's an array
    console.log('2. Is array?:', Array.isArray(rawData));

    // 3. Check for our specific workflow
    const hasOurWorkflow = rawData.some(w => w.plan_id === 'PLAN_ANALYSIS_CALL_4');
    console.log('3. Has PLAN_ANALYSIS_CALL_4?:', hasOurWorkflow);

    // 4. Check the status of our workflow
    const ourWorkflow = rawData.find(w => w.plan_id === 'PLAN_ANALYSIS_CALL_4');
    console.log('4. Our workflow status:', ourWorkflow?.status);
    console.log('5. Our workflow type:', ourWorkflow?.workflow_type);
  })();

  This will immediately tell them if the issue is API parsing or UI filtering.

  Your analysis is solid, but make sure they check the data flow path first before jumping to filter fixes!
