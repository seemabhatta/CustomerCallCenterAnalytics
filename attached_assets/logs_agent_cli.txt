Agent: It looks like I successfully retrieved the pipeline for the customer’s recent call (CALL_F67726F0), but unfortunately, there are no details available at this time.
This includes the transcript, analysis, action plan, and workflows, which means there are currently no pending workflows to address.

Here are a couple of next steps you might consider:

1. **Check for Recent Calls:** If you want to see if there are other recent calls that might have action items, I can list those for you.

2. **Follow Up with the Customer:** If you have any specific concerns or topics you want to discuss with the customer, we can initiate a follow-up based on previous
interactions.

Please let me know how you’d like to proceed!
