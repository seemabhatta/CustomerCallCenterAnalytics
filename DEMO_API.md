# ü§ñ Co-Pilot API Demo - Intelligent Teammate in Action

## üìã LLM Execution Instructions

**FOR LLM AGENTS**: This demo is designed to be executed sequentially. Each step dynamically passes its outputs to subsequent steps. When executing:

1. **Execute steps in order** - Each step depends on variables from previous steps
2. **Track all variables** - The Python examples initialize and maintain variables throughout:
   - `transcript_id` (from Step 1)
   - `analysis_id` (from Step 2) 
   - `plan_id` (from Step 3)
   - `action_ids[]` (extracted in Step 4)
   - `governance_id` (from Step 5a)
   - `approval_id` (from Step 5c)
   - `execution_id` (from Step 7)
3. **No hardcoded values** - All IDs and data are extracted from actual API responses
4. **Error handling** - If any step fails, report the error and stop execution
5. **Output verification** - Each step prints the variables it will pass to next steps

> **Prerequisites:** 
> 1. **OpenAI API Key Required**: Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with valid API key
> 2. Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`  
> 3. Ensure the backend is running: `./start_services.sh`
> 4. **FastAPI Server Running**: Accessible at `http://localhost:8000`
>
> **‚ö†Ô∏è NO FALLBACK Policy**: System requires proper OpenAI API integration. No mock/fallback responses.

## üéØ Co-Pilot Vision: Three Modes in Action

This demo showcases the **Intelligent Teammate** vision from [docs/01. vision_v2.md](docs/01.%20vision_v2.md), demonstrating how the Co-Pilot operates in three collaborative modes:

### üß≠ **Plan Mode**: Real-Time Strategy
- Co-Pilot instantly proposes action steps during customer interactions
- Risk assessment with predictive outcomes and approval routing
- Four-layer planning (Borrower ‚Üí Advisor ‚Üí Supervisor ‚Üí Leadership)

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute Mode**: Background Co-Execution  
- Automated execution of approved actions while advisor focuses on customer
- Actor simulation: emails, callbacks, CRM updates, document generation
- Compliance-aware execution with human oversight

### üìä **Reflect Mode**: Continuous Learning
- Post-call analysis with Observer Agent evaluation
- Performance feedback and coaching opportunities
- Learning loop that improves future interactions

plan_details = response.json()

# Extract action IDs for governance submission
action_ids = []
print("üìÑ Four-Layer Action Plan:")
for layer in ["borrower_plan", "advisor_plan", "supervisor_plan", "leadership_plan"]:
    actions = plan_details[layer]["actions"]
    print(f"\nüéØ {layer.replace('_', ' ').title()}: {len(actions)} actions")
    for action in actions[:2]:  # Show first 2 actions
        action_ids.append(action['action_id'])  # Collect action IDs
        print(f"  ‚Ä¢ {action['description']} (Risk: {action['risk_score']:.2f})")
        print(f"    Action ID: {action['action_id']}")

## Step 5. Submit Plan for Governance Review & Approval

**Co-Pilot Mode**: ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute Mode** - Governance validation and approval workflow

**Purpose**: Submit the action plan through the governance framework for compliance validation and risk-based approval routing.

> **üõ°Ô∏è New Governance Integration**: Actions now go through LLM-based compliance validation before traditional approval workflow.

### Step 5a: Submit for Governance Review
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/governance/submit" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "plan_id": "'$PLAN_ID'",
       "actions": [
         {
           "action_id": "action_20241201_001",
           "description": "Send PMI removal eligibility documentation",
           "risk_score": 0.25,
           "financial_impact": false,
           "compliance_required": ["CFPB_PMI_DISCLOSURE"]
         },
         {
           "action_id": "action_20241201_008", 
           "description": "Review property valuation dispute escalation",
           "risk_score": 0.78,
           "financial_impact": true,
           "compliance_required": ["CFPB_ERROR_RESOLUTION", "STATE_FORECLOSURE"]
         }
       ],
       "submitted_by": "advisor_mike",
       "urgency": "high"
     }'
```

### Step 5b: Check Governance Status
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/governance/status/$GOVERNANCE_ID"
```

### Step 5c: Traditional Approval Workflow (for approved actions)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/approvals/submit" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "plan_id": "'$PLAN_ID'",
       "submitted_by": "advisor_mike",
       "priority": "high",
       "notes": "Customer escalation requires immediate supervisor review",
       "governance_id": "'$GOVERNANCE_ID'"
     }'
```

### Python SDK Example:
```python
# Step 5a: Submit for Governance Review using actual action data
print(f"\nUsing plan_id: {plan_id} and action_ids from Step 4")

# Build actions list from actual plan details
actions_for_governance = []

                "description": action['description'],
                "risk_score": action.get('risk_score', 0.5),
                "financial_impact": action.get('financial_impact', False),
                "compliance_required": action.get('compliance_required', ["CFPB_GENERAL"])

### Error Handling:
```bash
# Test governance error response
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/governance/status/nonexistent_governance_id"
# Expected: 404 with {"detail": "Governance ID nonexistent_governance_id not found"}

# Test plan error response
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/plans/nonexistent_plan"
# Expected: 404 with {"detail": "Plan nonexistent_plan not found"}
```

### Performance Testing:
```python
import time
import concurrent.futures

def analyze_transcript(transcript_id):
    start = time.time()
    response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/analysis/analyze",
                           json={"transcript_id": transcript_id})
    duration = time.time() - start
    return {"transcript_id": transcript_id, "duration": duration, "success": response.status_code == 200}

# Test concurrent analysis
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(analyze_transcript, f"transcript_{i:03d}") for i in range(1, 6)]
    results = [future.result() for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures)]

avg_duration = sum(r["duration"] for r in results) / len(results)
print(f"Average API Response Time: {avg_duration:.3f}s")
```
